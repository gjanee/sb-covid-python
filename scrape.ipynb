It's hard to imagine how they could have made the data harder to extract, seeing as what is counted, how it is counted, and how counts are presented have all changed multiple times since the pandemic began.  Our goal is to extract cumulative total confirmed cases (only) broken down by date and by geographic area within the county.  Without going to significantly more work, this is possible only as far back as April 27, 2020.\n",
